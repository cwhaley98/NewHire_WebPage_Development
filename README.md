# NewHire_WebPage_Development
This repo is to showcase a recent project, I had contributed in its development with my employer. This was developed and deployed using WordPress.

## Project Overview

This project was developed to create a more efficient and streamlined onboarding experience for new hires by providing a dedicated, self-service portal for equipment setup. By creating two distinct webpages—one for administrative staff and another for agents—this solution directly addresses the challenge of a fragmented and often time-consuming manual onboarding process.

Key Features
Dual Onboarding Portals: The project features two separate, purpose-built webpages: one for Admin New Hires and another for Agent New Hires. This separation ensures that each role receives instructions and guidance tailored specifically to their equipment and Day 1 needs.

Clear, Step-by-Step Instructions: Each portal contains a comprehensive, easy-to-follow guide for new employees. This resource walks them through the entire equipment setup process, empowering them to complete their tasks independently and correctly.

Reduced Manual Overhead: By centralizing and standardizing the onboarding information, the project significantly reduces the time and effort previously spent by IT and administrative staff on walking new hires through setup.

Improved User Experience: New hires are no longer dependent on immediate assistance, leading to a smoother and more positive first-day experience.

Technology Stack
WordPress: The project was built on the WordPress platform, leveraging its user-friendly content management system. This choice allows non-technical team members to easily update and maintain the instructional content as processes or equipment change.

Web Development Fundamentals: The solution relies on foundational web technologies including HTML and CSS to structure and style the content effectively.

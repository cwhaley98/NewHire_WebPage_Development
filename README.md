## Project Overview

The primary objective of this project was to increase operational efficiency during the onboarding phase. By delivering role-specific instructions through a dedicated web interface, the project reduced the burden on IT support and improved "Day 1" readiness for new employees.

### Key Features

* **Dual-Stream Portals:** Distinct, purpose-built pages for **Admin** and **Agent** roles, ensuring users only see the hardware and software instructions relevant to their specific position.
* **Self-Service Guidance:** Comprehensive, step-by-step documentation that empowers new hires to complete equipment configuration independently.
* **Operational Efficiency:** Significantly reduced manual overhead for administrative and IT departments by standardizing the instructional delivery method.
* **Enhanced UX:** A clean, intuitive interface designed to minimize first-day friction and technical confusion.

## Technical Note: Secure Messaging Integration
